              Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious
              medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you

              Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the
              most common mental disorders. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention (not being able to keep focus),
              hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting)
              and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought).

              Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life. You might feel anxious
              when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or before
              making an important decision. But anxiety disorders involve more than
              temporary worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the
              anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time.

                Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in
                 some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event.
                It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation.
                Fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend
                against danger or to avoid it. This “fight-or-flight” response is a typical
                reaction meant to protect a person from harm.

                Antisocial personality disorder, sometimes called sociopathy, is
                a mental condition in which a person consistently shows no regard
                for right and wrong and ignores the rights and feelings of others.
                People with antisocial personality disorder tend to antagonize,
                manipulate or treat others harshly or with callous indifference.
                They show no guilt or remorse for their behavior.
