          All Mental Health Issues are treatable in some way. They all vary, but it comes down
          to whether or not one gets the treatment one needs for themselves. These treatments range
          from meditation to support groups.
          <strong> BUT ALWAYS SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP!</strong>
